    <p>
      Hey there. My name is Robin Wieruch and over the last year I have written{' '}
      <a href="https://roadtoreact.com/">two ebooks ðŸ“š</a> about React.js. One
      of those ebooks was downloaded over 13.000 times, is for free and yet is
      in its 4th edition after being out for only 12 months. It went from 90
      pages to 190 pages. The{' '}
      <a href="https://slack-the-road-to-learn-react.wieruch.com/">
        community
      </a>{' '}
      and I keep it updated, because there are always improvements to teach
      React and it should incluce all the recent best practices from the React
      ecosystem. ðŸ¦Š
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        This is one of the most well-written & informative coding books I've
        ever worked through. A solid React & ES6 introduction.

      The feedback about those ebooks that I received the most was about the
      usage of concise JavaScript that I accomplish by using functional
      programming principles. Yet the code stays readable and maintainable.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over time, I collected ideas on how I could funnel this knowledge about
      concise JavaScript into an ebook. The ebook should be for free and
      accessible for everyone, but therefore I would need your support to make
      it happen! ðŸš€

        - The Road to Learn React by Robin Wieruch is such an awesome book! Most
        of what I learned about React and even ES6 was through it!
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Therefore, I wanted to give crowdfunding a shot. ðŸŒŸ It would give me the
      neccessary fundings to work fulltime on the ebook for the next two months.
      If you like to see an ever green JavaScript ebook, driven by the
      community, about concise and functional JavaScript, you can support it
      now.
    </p>

    <h2>My Plan</h2>

    <p>
      I want to write the ebook almost fulltime for the next 2 months and you
      can follow me in realtime on this journey. It should give you a clear path
      beyond the basics of JavaScript. It is aimed at intermediate JavaScript
      developers, however, I believe advanced JavaScript developers would learn
      the one or other trick as well from it.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Thanks, really loved the book. Perfect blend to learn React, ES6, and
        higher level programming concepts.
      </p>

    <p>
      There are already a couple of JavaScript ebooks teaching intermediate
      concepts, but I hope to position the ebook with the primary focus on
      writing concise yet readable JavaScript by using functional programming
      principles and vanilla JavaScript built-in functionalities.
    </p>

    <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={monokai}>
      {codeStringOne}
    </SyntaxHighlighter>

    <p>
      The primary idea is to show you refactorings from loop, switch case and
      if-else statements to using functions such as map, reduce, and filter in a
      concise way.
    </p>

    <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={monokai}>
      {codeStringTwo}
    </SyntaxHighlighter>

    <p>
      But it should go even deeper by implementing these built-in
      functionalities from vanilla JavaScript or popular utility libraries such
      as <a href="https://lodash.com/">Lodash</a> and{' '}
      <a href="http://ramdajs.com/">Ramda</a> on your own, showing how they work
      in a functional programming context, and getting comfortable with advanced
      functionalities such as curry and flow functions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Furthermore, the ebook should be a practical way to learn those things. So
      you will code youself while reading the ebook to enforce your learnings. I
      aim to enrich it with exercises as well.
    </p>

    <h2>Goals and Perks</h2>

    <p>
      This crowd funding campaign runs until I am able to release the ebook. I
      would aim to make it happen end of December 2017. Even though it doesn't
      get the neccessary fundings, I hope that I can find the resources to make
      it happen. The ebook will come into existence in some form.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        If more than <strong>2500 â‚¬</strong> are funded, I am going to do it!
      </li>
      <li>
        If more than <strong>3500 â‚¬</strong> are funded, I am hiring an
        editor/proofreader!
      </li>
      <li>
        If more than <strong>4000 â‚¬</strong> are funded, I am hiring an
        illustrator!
      </li>
      <li>
        If more than <strong>5000 â‚¬</strong> are funded, I provide useful source
        code projects to enhance the learning experience!
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The payments are handled by <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> and
      thus your credit card details are securely managed by them. Furthermore,
      the ebook will be available for free on an official website and GitHub
      repository. So what are the perks of contributon to this crowdfunding
      campaing if it is not only a free JavaScript ebook for you and the
      community?
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        If you contribute <strong>5 â‚¬ or more</strong>, you will be notified
        about the release to grab a free eboob in PDF, EPUB or MOBI.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you contribute <strong>25 â‚¬ or more</strong>, you can choose to be
        included in the list of backers on the official website.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you contribute <strong>75 â‚¬ or more</strong>, you can choose to be
        included in the list of backers in the ebook.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you contribute <strong>500 â‚¬ or more</strong>, your name, logo and
        link will be included in the list of backers on the official website and
        in the ebook.

      So I have never done such a crowdfunding campaing before and I am excited
      to see people invested in this project. I always relied on my own
      resources to write my content that was read by many people though, but
      this time I hope to get the help of the community to produce a free ebook
      as a fulltime profession.
