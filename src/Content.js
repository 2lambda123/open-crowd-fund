    <h1>Refactoring to concise JavaScript</h1>

    <p>
      Hey there. My name is Robin Wieruch and over the last year I have written{' '}
      <a href="https://roadtoreact.com/">two ebooks ðŸ“š</a> about React.js. One
      of theese ebooks was downloaded over 13.000 times, it is for free and currently
      in its 4th edition after being out for only 12 months. It went from 90
      pages to 190 pages. The community and I keep it updated, because there are always improvements to teach
      React and it should include all the recent best practices from the React
      ecosystem. ðŸ¦Š
    </p>

        This is one of the most well-written & informative coding books I've
        ever worked through. A solid React & ES6 introduction.

        Just finished your Road to React. Best book for a beginner in the world

      I never thought about self-publishing an ebook. But as I did it, the feedback about it was incredible.
      The feedback that I received the most was about the usage of concise JavaScript which is
      accomplished by using functional programming principles. Hence, the code
      stays readable and maintainable in the long run.

        - The Road to Learn React by Robin Wieruch is such an awesome book! Most
        of what I learned about React and even ES6 was through it!
      </p>

    <p>
      Over time, I collected ideas on how I could funnel this knowledge about
      concise JavaScript into an ebook. The ebook should be for free and
      accessible for everyone, but therefore I would need your support to make
      it happen! ðŸš€
    </p>

    <p>
      Hence, I wanted to give crowdfunding a shot. ðŸŒŸ It would give me the
      necessary fundings to work full-time on the self-published ebook for the next two months.
      If you like to see an ever green JavaScript ebook, driven by the
      community, about functional and concise JavaScript, you can support it
      now.

    <h2>The Pitch</h2>

    <p>Lorem ipsum ...</p>

    <h2>Goals and Perks</h2>

    <p>
      This crowd funding campaign runs until I am able to release the ebook. I
      would aim to make it happen end of 2017 or beginning of 2018. It depends
      on your interest in the ebook. Even if it doesn't get the necessary
      fundings, I hope that I can find the resources to make it happen. The
      ebook will come into existence in some form.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        If more than <strong>100 â‚¬</strong> are funded, I am able to create the ebook on <a href="https://leanpub.com/the-road-to-learn-react">Leanpub</a>!
      </li>
      <li>
        If more than <strong>2500 â‚¬</strong> are funded, I am going to do it!

      I have never done such a crowdfunding campaign before and I am excited
      to see people invested in this project. I have always relied on my own
      resources to write free content that was read by many people though, but
      this time I hope to get the help of the community to produce a free ebook
      as a full-time vocation.

      Thank you for reading and for your support, Robin Wieruch
